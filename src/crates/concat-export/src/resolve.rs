//! The flattened clip list becoming the engine's timeline.
//!
//! `flatten` turns the document into `ExportClip`s; this turns those into
//! a `concat_core::Timeline` plus the per-clip facts the decoders and the
//! compositor need that the engine's model has no field for. It is the
//! one place document times become rational seconds. Frame-aligned clip
//! endpoints remain exact frame rationals; genuinely subframe endpoints and
//! source positions retain microsecond precision. Output sampling and
//! frame-shaped transition ramps use the output frame grid.
//! Every chain, pass, size and mask
//! a clip renders with is decided here. `render` and the preview read
//! what this builds and never look at an `ExportClip` again.
