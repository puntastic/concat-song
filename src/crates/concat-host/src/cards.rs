//! Effect cards: every picture package's still, drawn by the package.
//!
//! A card is one reference picture through a package at its defaults,
//! drawn by the same shader and the same compositor a clip's frames go
//! through, so a card shows what the effect does and cannot drift from it.
//! An effect or a look treats the picture; a text effect treats a title set
//! over it; a transition cuts from the picture to a mirrored, hue-turned
//! copy of it, partway through. A package with no shader - someone's own
//! format 1 package - is drawn through its FFmpeg chain. Whatever a card
//! leaves transparent - a mask, a key - shows a checkerboard. A package
//! whose defaults show little on a card says what its card shows in its
//! manifest's `[card]` table: knob values, the moment, the point of the
//! cut, a screen behind the picture for a key to take out.
//!
//! Cards are drawn once and kept as JPEGs in a folder, each named after its
//! package and a fingerprint of everything it was drawn from: the shader,
//! the knobs' defaults, the table, and how cards are drawn. A package whose
//! shader or defaults change has a new name and so a new card, and the old
//! one is swept away ([`prune`]). Callers can inspect the cached reference
//! previews or draw further ones through [`Painter`] without a display toolkit.
